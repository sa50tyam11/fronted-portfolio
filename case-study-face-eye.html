    <h1>Face & Eye Detection — Offline attendance prototype</h1>
    <p class="muted">Role: Lead engineer · Stack: C++ · OpenCV · Haar cascades</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Build a privacy-preserving, offline attendance capture that runs on commodity laptops without cloud dependency. Constraints: low CPU, limited memory, and varying indoor lighting.</p>

    <h3>Solution & architecture</h3>
    <p>Single-process pipeline: webcam capture → CLAHE preprocessing → Haar-based face detection → eye detection → temporal consensus filter → CSV logger. Design prioritized deterministic CPU usage and predictable latency. CLI for export and basic reporting.</p>

    <h3>Trade-offs</h3>
    <p>Haar cascades were chosen over DNN models to avoid GPU requirements and heavy dependencies. This lowered raw accuracy but ensured immediate deployability and stable performance on low-end hardware.</p>

    <h3>Testing & metrics</h3>
    <p>Field-tested across multiple sessions, tuned temporal window to reduce false positives. Achieved >85% detection in standard indoor conditions after tuning.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>Delivered a prototype producing CSV attendance logs. Validated product hypothesis without cloud costs and reduced administrative effort for the client.</p>
